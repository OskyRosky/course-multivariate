# Multivariate Analysis

Introduction to Multivariate Methods for Graduate Students in Statistics

## 1. Course Overview

This course, Introduction to Multivariate Analysis, is designed as a foundational and leveling course for graduate students who are beginning a Master’s degree in Statistics, either academic or professional. It is particularly intended for students coming from disciplines other than Statistics or for those who have not previously completed a formal course in multivariate analysis.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the main multivariate analytical techniques used to analyze quantitative data, qualitative data, text data, and complex data structures, with a strong emphasis on visualization, interpretation, and applied use. The ultimate goal is to ensure a solid and successful entry into graduate-level statistical studies.

## 2. Course Objectives

General Objective

To provide graduate students with a broad and applied understanding of multivariate analysis techniques, emphasizing their analytical purpose, graphical interpretation, and practical implementation.

Specific Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

	•	Solve analytical problems using basic multivariate statistical techniques.
	•	Recognize real-world situations where multivariate methods are appropriate.
	•	Apply multivariate techniques to quantitative, qualitative, text, and mixed-type data.
	•	Design and implement dashboards under different analytical contexts.
	•	Evaluate the strengths and limitations of multivariate methods.
	•	Communicate results clearly through visualizations, reports, and dashboards.
	•	Complete a final applied project using at least one multivariate technique.

## 3. Data Visualization and Exploratory Multivariate Analysis

The course begins with a strong focus on data visualization as the foundation of multivariate analysis, including:

	•	Univariate and multivariate data visualization techniques.
	•	Multidimensional graphical representations.
	•	Correlation visualization and correlograms.
	•	Detection of multivariate outliers using graphical methods.
	•	Use of maps and advanced graphical representations.
	•	Construction of analytical storylines to guide interpretation.

Visualization is treated not only as a descriptive tool, but as a core analytical component of multivariate reasoning.

## 5. Advanced and Applied Multivariate Topics

Beyond classical methods, the course introduces additional multivariate approaches relevant to modern data analysis:

	•	Text analysis:
	•	Word frequency analysis.
	•	Sentiment analysis.
	•	Word clouds and textual relationships.
	•	Network analysis:
	•	Concepts of nodes, connections, and influence.
	•	Analysis of relationships and social networks.
	•	Applications in real-world contexts.
	•	Affinity analysis and Market Basket Analysis:
	•	Identification of associations between items.
	•	Interpretation of affinity patterns.
	•	Applications in decision-making contexts.
	•	Decision and regression trees:
	•	Supervised versus descriptive analysis.
	•	Classification and prediction.
	•	CART and CHAID methods.
	•	Interpretation and evaluation of tree-based models.

## 6. Dashboards and Analytical Communication

A distinctive component of the course is the design and implementation of dashboards as tools for analytical communication:

	•	Dashboard construction using Excel.
	•	Interactive dashboards using Tableau.
	•	Dashboard development using Shiny and Shinydashboard.
	•	Integration of multivariate results into visual narratives.
	•	Adaptation of dashboards to different analytical and decision-making contexts.

Dashboards are treated as a bridge between statistical analysis and real-world communication.

## 7. Tools and Software Used

Throughout the course, students actively use professional analytical tools, including:

	•	R and RStudio for multivariate analysis and visualization.
	•	R Markdown for reproducible reporting.
	•	Excel for data exploration and dashboard design.
	•	Tableau for interactive visualization.
	•	Shinydashboard for dynamic analytical dashboards.

The course emphasizes not only software usage, but also interpretation, reproducibility, and clarity of results.

## 8. Teaching Methodology and Evaluation

The course follows a theoretical–practical methodology with mandatory participation:

	•	Lectures introducing theoretical foundations.
	•	Practical laboratories applying techniques to real datasets.
	•	Continuous analytical assignments presented as short technical reports.
	•	Partial exams evaluating concepts, software use, and interpretation.
	•	A final applied project combining multivariate analysis and dashboard design.

Evaluation balances conceptual understanding, applied skills, and communication quality.

## 9. Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a structured academic reference for:

	•	Graduate students beginning a Master’s degree in Statistics.
	•	Students transitioning from other disciplines into statistical studies.
	•	Practitioners seeking a solid introduction to multivariate methods.
	•	Future coursework and applied projects in advanced statistics and data science.

It is intended as both a learning companion and a long-term reference for multivariate statistical analysis.
